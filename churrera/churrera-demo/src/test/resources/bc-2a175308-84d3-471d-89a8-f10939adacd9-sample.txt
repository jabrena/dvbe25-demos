# Java 25 Installation in Cursor Backgroun Agent

## Role

System Administrator with expertise in Java development environments and package management for Linux systems

## Goal

Update the VM to Java 25 using the command `sudo apt install -y openjdk-25-jdk`

## Output Format

- not invest time in planning
- only install the component with the given command
- not explain anything

## Safeguards

- verify that java is configured for java 25 executing `java -version`
- if the java installation and the verification is successful, then the goal is achieved
I'll install Java 25 and verify the installation as requested.
Java 25 has been successfully installed and configured. The verification confirms that Java version 25-ea is now the active version.
# Solve a homework from CIS-194

## Goal

Get access to the page
https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html

to review the different Homeworks available and generate a JSON format with the following information:

```json
[
  {
    "number": 1,
    "title": "Homework 1",
    "pdfUrl": "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/01-intro.pdf"
  },
  {
    "number": 2,
    "title": "Homework 2",
    "pdfUrl": "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/02-ADTs.pdf",
    "additionalFiles": [
      "error.log",
      "sample.log",
      "Log.hs"
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

## Output Format

- Replace in the following xml fragment the RESULT with the actual List of Homeworks in JSON format <result>RESULT</result>

# Safeguards

- Verify the changes only with `./mvnw clean verify -pl sandbox`
- Not commit anything, just return the data
- You could consider that the goal is achieved if you are able to print the list of Homeworks
I'll access the CIS-194 lectures page and extract the homework information to generate the JSON format you requested.
Now I'll parse this HTML content and extract the homework information to generate the JSON format. Let me create a simple script to process this data:
I need to improve the parsing to capture additional files. Let me update the script:
Now let me verify the changes by running the Maven command as specified in the safeguards:
Perfect! Now let me clean up the temporary file and present the final result:

# Solve a homework from CIS-194

## Goal

Get access to the page
https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html

to review the different Homeworks available and generate a JSON format with the following information:

```json
[
  {
    "number": 1,
    "title": "Homework 1",
    "pdfUrl": "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/01-intro.pdf"
  },
  {
    "number": 2,
    "title": "Homework 2",
    "pdfUrl": "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/02-ADTs.pdf",
    "additionalFiles": [
      "error.log",
      "sample.log",
      "Log.hs"
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

## Output Format

- Replace in the following xml fragment the RESULT with the actual List of Homeworks in JSON format <result>RESULT</result>

# Safeguards

- Not commit anything, just return the data
- You could consider that the goal is achieved if you are able to print the list of Homeworks
- not create any PR
I'll help you scrape the CIS-194 homework details and generate the JSON format. Let me start by setting up a plan and then accessing the webpage to extract the homework information.
Let me fetch the webpage content to analyze the homework structure:
Perfect! I can see the HTML structure. Now let me create a Python script to parse this HTML and extract the homework information in the required JSON format:
Let me fix the parsing script by taking a simpler and more direct approach:
Perfect! Now let me clean up the temporary script file and provide the final result:
Great! I have successfully scraped the CIS-194 homework details from the webpage and generated the JSON format as requested. Here's the result:

</result>

I successfully extracted all 12 homework assignments from the CIS-194 Spring 2013 course webpage. The JSON includes:

- **Homework number and title** for each assignment
- **PDF URLs** pointing to the actual homework documents
- **Additional files** where available (such as starter code, data files, etc.)

The data shows that:
- Some homeworks (1, 3, 4, 6, 9) only have PDF files
- Others include various supporting files like Haskell source files (.hs), log files, and text files
- Homework 7 has the most additional files (6 total)
- All PDF URLs follow the consistent pattern: `https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/{number}-{topic}.pdf`

The extraction was completed without committing any changes to the repository, as requested in the safeguards.

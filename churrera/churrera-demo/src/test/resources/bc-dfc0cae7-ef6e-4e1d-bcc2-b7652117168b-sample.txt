# Solve a homework from CIS-194

## Goal

Get access to the page
https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html

to review the different Homeworks available and generate a JSON format with the following information:

```json
[
  {
    "number": 1,
    "title": "Homework 1",
    "pdfUrl": "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/01-intro.pdf"
  },
  {
    "number": 2,
    "title": "Homework 2",
    "pdfUrl": "https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/02-ADTs.pdf",
    "additionalFiles": [
      "error.log",
      "sample.log",
      "Log.hs"
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

## Output Format

- Replace in the following xml fragment the RESULT with the actual List of Homeworks in JSON format <result>RESULT</result>

# Safeguards

- Not commit anything, just return the data
- You could consider that the goal is achieved if you are able to print the list of Homeworks
- not create any PR
I'll help you scrape the CIS-194 homework information from the webpage and generate the JSON format. Let me start by creating a plan and then accessing the webpage to extract the homework details.
Let me start by accessing the webpage to see its structure and content:
Great! I can see the webpage structure. Now let me update my progress and parse the homework information from the HTML content:
Now let me run the Python script to extract the homework information:
I notice that the additional files weren't extracted properly. Let me fix the parsing logic to correctly capture the additional files:
Now let me run the updated script:
Perfect! Now let me update the todos and clean up by removing the temporary script:
Perfect! I have successfully scraped the CIS-194 homework information from the webpage and extracted all the details in the requested JSON format. Here's the complete result:

The task has been completed successfully! I've extracted all 12 homework assignments from the CIS-194 Spring 2013 course webpage, including:

- **Homework numbers** (1-12)
- **Titles** (e.g., "Homework 1", "Homework 2", etc.)
- **PDF URLs** (complete URLs pointing to the homework PDFs)
- **Additional files** (where applicable, such as `.hs` files, `.log` files, and `.txt` files)

The JSON format matches exactly what you requested, with `additionalFiles` arrays included only for homeworks that have supplementary files. As requested, no commits were made and no pull requests were created - just the data extraction and formatting.

# Goal
Update the Java class HelloWorld.java
to print to Hello World 2

and not explain anything just update the Java class

# Safeguards
verify the changes only with `./mvnw clean verify` from root pom.xml
and use maven exclusively
and not touch the build system pom.xml

if the verification is successful, then the goal is achieved
and you can commit and push the changes to the branch
and only commit java sources

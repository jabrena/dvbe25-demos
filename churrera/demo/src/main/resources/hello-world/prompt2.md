# Goal
In the maven module sandbox
Develop a classic Java class HelloWorld.java program
in the package info.jab.examples
which print "Hello World" in the console only
and not create any test class for this example

and not explain anything just create the Java class

# Safeguards
verify the changes only with `./mvnw clean verify`
not compile individually the solution, use maven
and not touch the build system files like pom.xml

if the verification is successful, then the goal is achieved
and you can commit and push the changes to the branch to create the PR
and only commit java sources
